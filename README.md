# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

The run_analysis.R script will run as it should when placed in the same working directory as the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

run_analysis.R will:

load packages that will be used in the script;
read the entire working folder into R;
merge required data;
extract SD and mean values;
name the activities in the dataset;
tidy the data and clean it further.
